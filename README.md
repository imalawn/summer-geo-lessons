# Summer Geometry Lesson Selector
An easy-to-use site that allows a student to access the FCPS Summer Honors Geometry lesson material without needing to go through Schoology.
## Setup
### Local File (recommended)
Using this page as a local file will generally be more reliable, and it will also allow you to tweak it to your preference.
1. Download the `index.html` file either by cloning it or downloading it from the releases tab.
2. Double click the downloaded `index.html` file on your computer.
3. Bookmark the page that opens up when you open the file for easy quick access.
### Public Website (not currently available)
This page will simply be a website that you can open up and bookmark for a no-download, quick way to access your lesson material.
If it is released, it would either have its own domain (note that Freenom is down currently) or use the GitHub Pages URL (https://leckiqie.github.io/summer-geo-lessons).
### Self-Hosting
Since this is a static webpage, you can self-host it for free so other people can access it.
1. Fork this repository or download it.
2. If you forked the repository, link your GitHub account to your hosting service.
3. Create a new website on your hosting provider. Some good free options for static hosting are Netlify and CloudFlare Pages.
4. Use your forked repository to create the website, or import the HTML file to create it.
5. Link a domain if you prefer. Freenom was a good option for getting free domains, but it's currently not working for registering new domains.
## Usage
Once you are on the page, it should prompt you for a unit and lesson number. Note that the unit field requires a `0` in front of your unit number if your desired unit is not two-digits (e.g. 03 for Unit 3). For the lesson number, you can simply type which lesson you are on for the unit that you selected without adding a `0` in front.
###### Note: You can also use the up and down buttons that appear when hovering over the prompts to select your unit and lesson, but beware that it will not add a `0` in front of the unit number.
